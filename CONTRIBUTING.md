# Contributing

This project is open source and everyone can increase its value by contributing. This can be achieved through different ways, like reporting an issue, proposing new features or submitting code.


## Reporting an Issues

Issue reports should contain some key information, like:

- A short summary of the issue
- The command output
- Environment information like the terminal type (bash, zsh, etc...), system architecture (x86 or amd64) and other useful information
- If nessesary a longer description what happened and what you expected to happen


## Submitting Code

- All changes are submitted via pull requests and have to be approved by at least one maintainer
- Make sure the code is documented
- Pull requests should contain information about what and more importantly why the code was changed in a certain way
- Make sure to test your changes as nobody wants a broken setup

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome, but keep in mind that not every feature is helpful. If you propose an idea then make sure to give a quick summary as well as a more detailed one. Images or other ressources can also be helpful for others to understand the meaning.
